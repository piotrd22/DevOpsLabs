# Repo for university devops classes.

The project aimed to create a CRUD REST application that would have 100% test coverage. Then the entire application was dockerized and deployed on a local cluster on minikube (kubernetes). At the very end, we created CI/CD using Jenkins, which tests, builds and pushes the application image to a remote repository on DockerHub.
